## Compiling

Firstly, Good Luck!  You'll need version 2.0 of [GNU COBOL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/open-cobol/) to compile this code.

I can compile it on Mac OS X 10.12 and under Debian GNU/Linux (kernel 3.16.0-4-amd64) with:
```
cobc -x -free -std=default bams.cbl Attendees.cbl createAuthCode.cbl ListAttendeesScreen.cbl
```

I have had huge problems trying to get it to compile under Linux using this modular approach, and so I had to merge it back down into a monolithic version and loose the test suite for it.  You can compile this version with:
```
cobc -x -free -std=default -o bams  bams-monolith.cbl createAuthCode.cbl ListAttdendeesScreen.cbl
```

To get version 2.0 of GNU COBOL compiler (cobc), download it from https://sourceforge.net/projects/open-cobol/files/gnu-cobol/2.0/ (rc2 is the latest at the time of typing), untar/zip it, and (on Linux) do:
```
./configure --with-curses=check --prefix=/usr/local CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include/ LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib
make
make install
```
Check which version is running with:
```
which cobc
```
This should be the version '/usr/local/bin/cobc' but if it isn't, replace 'cobc' in the command lines to compile with '/usr/local/bin/cobc'.

## Setting up data

First compile the data importer:
```
cobc -std=default -x -free ImportAttendees.cbl
```
Now run it to import the test data:
```
./ImportAttendees bams-test-data.csv test-data.dat
```
Or real data:
```
./ImportAttendees <name of real csv file> attendees.dat
```

## Run BAMS

Just run it with:
 ```
 ./bams
 ```

or optionally with a specific data file:
 ```
 ./bams path/to/data-file.dat
 ```

## Run the test suite

To run the test suite, you'll need to download [COBOL Test Suite](https://github.com/mikebharris/COBOL-Test-Suite).

First import the test data (see above).

Next compile the test suite:
```
cobc -x -std=default -free AttendeesTest.cbl Attendees.cbl createAuthCode.cbl path/to/COBOL-Test-Suite/AssertEquals.cbl
```
Now run the test suite:

# Using BAMS

## Home Screen

The home screen looks like this:

In the middle you can see what the day is, and you can immediately tell how many adults and children are attending and how many are on-site already, and are to arrive.  There are three function key options:

F2 - View a given attendee, which takes you to the Enter Authcode Screen.
F3 - Add a new attendee, which takes you to the Add Attendee Screen.
F10 - Exit BAMS and return to the operating system.

## Enter Authcode Screen

Pressing F2 from the Home Screen will take you to the Enter Authcode Screen, which looks like this:
![Screen shot of BAMS Enter Authcode Screen](screenshots/enter-authcode-screen.png "BAMS Enter Authcode Screen")

You have four options:

Type in the desired Authcode and press enter.  If the Authcode entered exists, you'll arrive at the View Attendee screen.
F1 - go back to the Home Screen
F2 - Rather than enter the Authcode, go to the List Attendees Screen to search for it
F10 - Exit BAMS and return to the operating system
