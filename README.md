# BAMS
The BarnCamp Attendee Management System

A system for managing the Welcome Desk at [BarnCamp](https://barncamp.org.uk) written in GNU COBOL.

## Compiling

Firstly, Good Luck!  You'll need version 2.0 of [GNU COBOL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/open-cobol/) to compile this code.

I can compile it on Mac OS X 10.12 and under Debian GNU/Linux (kernel 3.16.0-4-amd64) with:
```
cobc -x -free -std=default bams.cbl Attendees.cbl createAuthCode.cbl ListAttendeesScreen.cbl
```

I have had huge problems trying to get it to compile under Linux using this modular approach, and so I had to merge it back down into a monolithic version and lose the test suite for it.  You can compile this version with:
```
cobc -x -free -std=default -o bams  bams-monolith.cbl createAuthCode.cbl ListAttendeesScreen.cbl
```

To get version 2.0 of GNU COBOL compiler (cobc), download it from https://sourceforge.net/projects/open-cobol/files/gnu-cobol/2.0/ (rc2 is the latest at the time of typing), untar/zip it, and (on Linux) do:
```
./configure --with-curses=check --prefix=/usr/local CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include/ LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib
make
make install
```
Check which version is running with:
```
which cobc
```
This should be the version '/usr/local/bin/cobc' but if it isn't, replace 'cobc' in the command lines to compile with '/usr/local/bin/cobc'.

## Setting up data

First compile the data importer:
```
cobc -std=default -x -free ImportAttendees.cbl
```
Now run it to import the test data:
```
./ImportAttendees bams-test-data.csv test-data.dat
```
Or real data:
```
./ImportAttendees <name of real csv file> attendees.dat
```

## Run BAMS

Just run it with:
 ```
 ./bams
 ```

or optionally with a specific data file:
 ```
 ./bams path/to/data-file.dat
 ```

If you find that the function keys don't seem to do what they should, check that they haven't been captured by your window manager or terminal emulator. For example in MATE terminal, F10 brings up the emulator menu so you can't exit the application.

## Run the test suite

To run the test suite, you'll need to download [COBOL Test Suite](https://github.com/mikebharris/COBOL-Test-Suite).

First import the test data (see above).

Next compile the test suite:
```
cobc -x -std=default -free AttendeesTest.cbl Attendees.cbl createAuthCode.cbl path/to/COBOL-Test-Suite/AssertEquals.cbl
```
Now run the test suite:
